#Hi! I am Purva.#

I am a bioinformatics scientist at the Translational Metabolic Laboratory (TML), Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. My core interest lies in developing and applying a range of bioinformatics and data analysis approaches to study and interpret large scale mass spectrometry (MS) based -omics datasets. I lead the computational metabolomics developments at TML. Together with my team, I focus on building novel algorithms and robust computational workflows that can help identify significant mass features of interest from untargeted MS-based metabolomics data. This knowledge can provide insights into complex metabolic mechanisms of diseases that further help in the identification of new differential biomarkers. With this, my team tries to achieve the key objective of translating our research into novel personalized diagnostics, hence making a real impact on healthcare. My research interests also extend in developing computational approaches for automated image processing and pattern recognition in biological images. 

I am also a part of the Netherlands X-omics initiative working unde the Data analysis, integration and stewardship pillar and the United for Metabolic Diseases (UMD) initiative developing for computational tools for multi-omics based projects.
